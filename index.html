                <h1>About Me</h1>

                <p>Hello! I am a 4th year student at UCSD majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm passionate about working with others
                to develop <i>client-focused</i> solutions, with a particular focus on performance optimizations. My favorite languages are <code>Java</code> and 
                <code>C++</code>. I'm <b>always</b> eager to learn more and <b>constantly</b> looking to improve my skills.
                </p>


                <p>Some hobbies of mine include swimming, playing the guitar, tutoring, and learning about things that randomly pique my interest,
                like emerging hardware technologies or game theory.
                </p>

                <h2>Social Compass</h2>
                <p>As a group of six, I helped develop a social compass android app using Java. The app allowed users to add their friends or family on the app, letting them
                see each other on the app on a compass with cardinal directions that moved along with the phone's gyroscope. The app also let them see how far they were from one another.
                I primarily contributed to the backend algorithms for calculating the distance between the user and landmarks or other people, as well as pulling their locations 
                from a shared server. I also helped to determine where the visuals representing these people on the screen depending on their relative distances should land.</p>

                    <summary>Purpose</summary>
                    <p>The Social Compass was designed around the idea that if a user was curious where their friends were in class or how far their family were, they could
                    open up their phone and easily see which direction they should head in to meet them.</p>
